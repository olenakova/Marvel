# Marvel Web Application

Marvel is a web application that serves as an information portal based on the Marvel API. It provides users with access to a vast array of data about characters and comics within the Marvel universe.

## Features

- Characters Tab: Presents a list of all characters, allowing users to select and load detailed information about each character, including descriptions, comics, and related links.
- Dynamic Character Loading: Users can dynamically load new characters and explore their content.
- Comics Tab: Loads various comics and their details, including the ability to view each comic, its details, purchase options, and prices.

## Technologies Used

The Marvel website is built using the following technologies:

- JavaScript
- React
- React Hooks
- React Router v6+
- React Transition Group
- Yup
- Formik
- React Helmet

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
